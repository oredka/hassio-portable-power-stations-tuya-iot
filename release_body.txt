## Release 2.2.1 - UI and Logging Improvements

This release improves the user experience by adding device-specific pictures and reducing log noise.

### What's New
- **Product Images**: Added high-quality pictures for **2E Syayvo** and **Apower 2000**. These will now appear as the icon for the main battery sensor in Home Assistant.
- **Improved Logging**: Intermittent "device is offline" errors caused by Tuya cloud lag are now logged as WARNING instead of ERROR, keeping your Home Assistant Logbook cleaner.

### Installation
Update via HACS or by copying the `custom_components/tuya_iot_power_stations` folder to your Home Assistant installation.
