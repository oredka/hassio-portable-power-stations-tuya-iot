## Release 2.2.0 - Multi-device & Energy Dashboard Support

This release brings official support for the **Apower 2000** station and several improvements to the Energy Dashboard integration.

### What's New
- **Multi-device Support**: Officially added support for **Apower 2000** portable power stations.
- **USB Output Control**: Added `switch.usb_enabled` to control USB output for compatible stations.
- **Energy Dashboard Support**: Added `Battery Charge Energy` and `Battery Discharge Energy` sensors (kWh) for stations that report them.
- **USB Status**: Added `binary_sensor.usb_output_status` for monitoring USB port activity.

### Fixes and Improvements
- **Power Scaling**: Fixed power readings for stations using 1W units (removed incorrect division by 10 for values > 1000W).
